# Headings One

But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the
offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so
that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching his appellative,
it stood something like this:—

Quohog. his X mark.

## Heading Two

"From the moment of the first signs of it, a man would be dead in an
hour. Some lasted for several hours. Many died within ten or fifteen
minutes of the appearance of the first signs.

"The heart began to beat faster and the heat of the body to increase.
Then came the scarlet rash, spreading like wildfire over the face and
body. Most persons never noticed the increase in heat and heart-beat,
and the first they knew was when the scarlet rash came out. Usually,
they had convulsions at the time of the appearance of the rash. But
these convulsions did not last long and were not very severe. If one
lived through them, he became perfectly quiet, and only did he feel a
numbness swiftly creeping up his body from the feet. The heels became
numb first, then the legs, and hips, and when the numbness reached as
high as his heart he died. They did not rave or sleep. Their minds
always remained cool and calm up to the moment their heart numbed and
stopped. And another strange thing was the rapidity of decomposition. No
sooner was a person dead than the body seemed to fall to pieces, to fly
apart, to melt away even as you looked at it. That was one of the
reasons the plague spread so rapidly. All the billions of germs in a
corpse were so immediately released.

### Heading Three

As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,
and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,
unless they previously produced their papers.

"What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?" said I, now jumping on the
bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.

#### Heading Four

But with it came a sudden realization of what meant to me a real
catastrophe—Dian was gone, and with her a half-dozen other prisoners.
The guards saw it too, and the ferocity of their rage was terrible to
behold. Their awesome, bestial faces were contorted in the most
diabolical expressions, as they accused each other of responsibility for
the loss. Finally they fell upon us, beating us with their spear shafts,
and hatchets. They had already killed two near the head of the line, and
were like to have finished the balance of us when their leader finally
put a stop to the brutal slaughter. Never in all my life had I witnessed
a more horrible exhibition of bestial rage—I thanked God that Dian had
not been one of those left to endure it.

Of the twelve prisoners who had been chained ahead of me each alternate
one had been freed commencing with Dian. Hooja was gone. Ghak remained.
What could it mean? How had it been accomplished? The commander of the
guards was investigating. Soon he discovered that the rude locks which
had held the neckbands in place had been deftly picked.

##### Heading Five

"Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West," replied the Beast.
"When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the
biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz."

So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and
tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly
at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the Lion
said:

###### Heading Six

"—change lobsters, and retire in same order," continued the Gryphon.

"Then, you know," the Mock Turtle went on, "you throw the—"

"The lobsters!" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

"—as far out to sea as you can—"

"Swim after them!" screamed the Gryphon.

"Turn a somersault in the sea!" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.

"Change lobsters again!" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

"Back to land again, and that"s all the first figure," said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
and quietly, and looked at Alice.

### Lists


  - "Why, as for that," answered Oz, "I think you are wrong to want a heart
  - It makes most people unhappy
  - If you only knew it, you are in luck not to have a heart

This is a paragraph before an **unnumbered** list (`ul`). Lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh
euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.

-   One.
-   Two.
-   Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that for
    short items lists look better if they are compactly presented,
    whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical
    spacing between items.
-   Four. This is the last item in this list. Let us terminate the list
    now without making any more fuss about it.

This is a paragraph before a **numbered** list (`ol`). Note that the
spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard to
tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs are
logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".

1.  One.
2.  Two.
3.  Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that if
    items are short, lists look better if they are compactly presented,
    whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical
    spacing between items.
4.  Four. This is the last item in this list. Let us terminate the list
    now without making any more fuss about it.
5.  Five
6.  Six
7.  Seven
8.  Eight
9.  Nine
10. Ten

This is a paragraph before a **definition** list (`dl`). In principle,
such a list should consist of *terms* and associated definitions. Lorem
ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy
nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.

Apple
:   is a fruit.

Banana
:   Is also a fruit.

Tomato
:   Is debatable. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing
    elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore
    magna aliquam erat volutpat.

### Text-level markup

-   ~~Deleted text~~ (`del` element used)
-   `a[i] = b[i] + c[i);` (computer code; `code` markup used)
-   this is *very* simple (`em` markup used for emphasizing a word)
-   **this is highlighted text** (`strong` markup used)
