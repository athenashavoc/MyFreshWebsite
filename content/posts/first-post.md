Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me? Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.

Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system. He felt surprise was wiser. He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.

Our first catch of the day. Stand by, ion control., Fire! The first transport is away. Feeling all right, sir? Just like new, Dack. How about you? Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself. I know what you mean. Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

Right, sir. Okay, that's it. Try it, Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off! Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-sevens. Well, forget the heavy equipment.

Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here. Not much time. Ben, Ben.

You'll find I'm full of surprises. Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true. No! All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought. Impressive...most impressive. Obi-Wan has taught you well.

There's something not right here. I feel cold, death. That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is.

Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports. Take care, sir. Thanks.
